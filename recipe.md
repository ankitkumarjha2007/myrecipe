All the oil will be used up. So add 1 tbsp oil to the same pan.
Add chopped onions and fry till they become translucent.
Add the ginger-garlic paste and saute for ½ minute or till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears.
Add the chopped tomatoes and saute till the tomatoes become soft and mushy.
If the tomato mixture becomes too dry and starts sticking to the pan, then add about ¼ cup water. Mix well and continue to cook.
All the above cooking is done in a open pan and you don’t need to cover the pan with the lid.
Add all the dry spice powders one by one.
Mix well and saute for a few seconds. 
Making Bhindi Masala
Add the sautéed bhindi, crushed kasuri methi & salt and mix so that the onion-tomato masala coats the okra well.
Cook for about 2 minutes. Stir in between. 
Then switch off the flame and add chopped coriander leaves. Mix again.
Serve bhindi masala hot or warm garnished with a few coriander leaves and accompanied with chapati, roti or naan.
